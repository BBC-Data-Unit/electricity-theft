# Electricity theft at record level in England and Wales - BBC analysis

In September 2023, the BBC's Shared Data Unit [analysed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-66847243) crime data from 42 police forces in England and Wales.

We found that reported cases on electricity theft had risen by 75% since 2012.

Experts suggested that cannabis farms, crypto-currency mining and the cost of living crisis could be behind the increase.

The charity Stay Energy Safe said they had seen an increase in calls, but could not say whether this was fully or partially the result of the economic climate.

The Shared Data looked at crime data for 42 police forces between 2012-13 and 2022-23.

## Findings

-   24 police forces saw an increase, two saw no change and 16 saw a decrease
-   Reported cases exceeded 3,000 for the first time in 2020-21, and exceeded 3,500 for the first time in 2021-22
